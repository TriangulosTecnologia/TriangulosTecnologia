# Tri√¢ngulos Tecnologia

## Our Team

We work with all levels of seniorities and if the professional doesn't master some topic, we'll provide all means to teach him/her in the best way we can do.

### Project Owner

### Designers

### Backend Developers

### Frontend Developers

We expect that frontend developers have the following knowledge when working with us.

#### 1. Creating high quality components

"High quality" components might sounds very subjective, so this is our definition for high quality:

- corresponds to the [designers](#designers) specification;
- approved by the team in a PR;
- is documented or commented if there is some complex logic;
- pass our [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules;
- is tested.

Once these conditions are safisfied, we consider the component implementation as high quality.

##### Technologies

- React
- Theme UI
- Storybook
- Jest and React Testing Library.

#### 2. Fetching data from API

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is our main choice to create APIs and [Relay](https://relay.dev/), our GraphQL client. We expect the developer:

- know how to interpret a `graphql.schema`;
- make queries and mutations using Relay.

##### Technologies

- GraphQL
- Relay

#### 3. Design the API

This task is done together with [backend developers](#backenddevelopers) and the [project owner](#projectowner). The `graphql.schema` file is the contract between [frontend](#frontenddevelopers) and [backend developers](#backenddevelopers). Because of this, designing the API as [frontend developers](#frontenddevelopers) means that they must know how to create a [GraphQL schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

We expect:

- know how to create a [GraphQL schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/);
- considerable understading about the project and its business rules;
- limitations of the backend (mainly [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)).

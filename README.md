## Our Team

### Designers

### Frontend Developers

We expect that frontend developers have the following knowledge when working with us. If he/she doesn't master somo topics, we'll provide all means to teach him/her in the best way we can do.

#### 1. Creating high quality components

"High quality" components might sounds very subjective, so this is our definition for high quality:

- corresponds to the [designer](#designers) specification;
- approved by the team in a PR;
- is documented or commented if there is some complex logic;
- pass our [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules;
- is tested.

Once these conditions are safisfied, we consider the component implementation as high quality.

Our stack requires that the developers knows these technologies:

- React
- Theme UI
- Storybook
- Jest and React Testing Library.

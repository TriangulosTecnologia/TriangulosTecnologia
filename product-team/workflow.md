# Product Team Workflow

Our product teams consist of having members of all domains to deliver the best product to our customers. We call them a cross-functional team because it has people from product with the role of the product manager (PM), marketing, design, and engineering. Even though we have the PM role, everyone should also assume part of the product manager role. Cross-functional teams bring some advantages:

- **a clear vision**: if everyone knows what they're building, they don't need to rely on PM to make some decisions.
- **design-led development**: it helps ensure projects provide a great user experience (UX). When the whole team knows its customer, the members can propose design enhancements to improve UX.
- **clear communication between the whole team**: engineers don't have the bureaucracy to ask for feedback from designers, or PMs don't need to wait weeks to update the team.

## What is the PM's role?

The product manager is the central point of the product team. Together with the whole team, there are many tasks they should do to guarantee the success of the product. To list the most important ones:

- **provide vision to the team**: this is the most important task because it enables the team to ship great products. The vision represents the "what." Once the whole team knows "what" they have to build, they can use their creativity and hard work to arrive there.

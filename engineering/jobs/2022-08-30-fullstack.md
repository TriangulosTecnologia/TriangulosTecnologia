# Kompass

Posted at: **August 3, 2022**

Role: **[Software Developer](../roles.md)**

Status: **Open**

Modality: **Remote**

Schedule: **Full-time**

## Job Description

We're looking for a full-stack web developer to build products with us full-time. Triângulos Tecnologia is a software house in the process of becoming a venture building. Our focus is on the products we make, not only the code. Because of this, we expect you to enjoy working not only as a software developer but also as a product developer (of course, with our support).

All our projects follow [our base stack](https://ttoss.dev/docs/engineering/Technologies/), composed of React.js, Node.js, and AWS.

Working with us may be good for you if you:
- use React.js, Node.js, and AWS and want to evolve on these technologies;
- like to work on the product, not only on the code;
- know how to manage yourself because we have only a 15 minutes weekly meeting;
- has familiarity with Kanban, ClickUp, and GitHub.

Working with us may **NOT** be good for you if you:
- want a position that deals only with code and not with the product;
- need a structured environment. As we're on the path to becoming a venture building, we're still developing our workflows;
- don't like to change projects often.

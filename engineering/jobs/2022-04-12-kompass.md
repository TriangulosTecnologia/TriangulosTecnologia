# Kompass

Posted at: **April 12, 2022**

Role: **[Software Developer](../roles.md#software-developer)**

Status: **Open**

Modality: **Remote**

Schedule: **Full-time**

## Job Description

We maintain a web application for Kompass Energia that provides Kompass managers and their customers with data about their solar projects. You can see more about the platform [here](https://www.triangulostecnologia.com/project-portal-kompass?lang=en).

Over the years, we've been implementing features and improving the system architecture to deliver value to our client, but with the cost of creating some technical debts. We need to make many improvements, but we also need to fix those debts.

Our idea is that, for every new feature we need to implement or bug we need to fix, we follow this procedure:

1. create tests to guarantee that the old code won't break;
1. document essential details about the module we're working on;
1. implement the feature or fix the bug following our new architectures and technologies.

You can see more details about [the prerequisites for this job and payments here](../roles.md#software-developer).

The application uses technologies like [Antd](https://ant.design/) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), but we'll migrate them to [our current stack.](../technologies.md). We'll also need to migrate the project's cloud resources to another AWS accountâ€”DynamoDB, AppSync API, and cronjobs on Lambda.

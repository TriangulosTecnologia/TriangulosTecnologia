# Career

We've created rules to support the career progression of people that work with us.

## Why did we create these rules?

- Remove the maximum subjectivity of promotions, avoid politics and encourage meritocracy.
- Every step toward the next role—learning new competencies—reflects in salary increases.
- Developers know what they need to do to progress.

## Rules

The rules we use to promote the members of your team:

- Each role has a base salary.
- Every person starts with 100% of the base salary.
- The professional must acquire some competencies to get promoted, which the whole team must validate.
- Each new competency reflects a raise (each has its specific percentage).
- The promotion happens when the salary reaches **150%** of its base.

Use this document to see more details about roles description, base salary, and more information about our roles.

## Competencies

The competencies we'll show below are correlated with [our technologies](./technologies.md) and processes so that every professional has a high probability of learning them on the project they work on. Of course, it won't be possible to learn specifics competencies because of its scope. For example, you can't practice Relay in a project using React Query. But these kinds of projects that don't have many of our competencies are the exception.

The team should enter into a consensus to validate if a member learned a new skill that can demonstrate by delivering high-quality software, writing blog posts, helping other team members, etc.

The table below shows the roles and their respective competency and salary raise.

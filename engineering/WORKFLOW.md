# Engineering Workflow

[Pull requests (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
are the final deliverable job of an engineer working with us. They aren't only about code, but the whole set of discussions, customer research, tests, implementations, documentation, and collaborations with other departmentsâ€”marketing, design, product.


## Principles

We follow the principles found in [The Principles of Product Development Flow](https://arantespp.com/flow).

3. **Finish WIP tasks:**
4. **Start new tasks:**
